# Manual Assessment Memo

**MEMORANDUM**<br>
**TO:** Mr. Manabu Aoki<br>
**FROM:** Kyler Bishop<br>
**SUBJECT:** Recommendations for AT-LP60 Turntable Manual<br>
**DATE:** February 13, 2025

I evaluated the manual for the Audio-Technica AT-LP60 Turntable manual, available at https://www.manua.ls/audio-technica/at-lp60/manual.

Overall, the manual is well-written and user-friendly. The use of diagrams and numbered lines to highlight features enhances the clarity of the instructions. Additionally, the guidance on the pre-amplifier and the Phono/Line switch is both clear and concise, with the accompanying graphic effectively illustrating its purpose. The inclusion of bold text to emphasize critical operational steps throughout the manual is also a commendable feature that aids users in navigating the content.

However, while the manual is strong in many areas, there are a few inconsistencies and opportunities for improvement. Specifically, the section titled, "Connecting to Computers or Audio Devices with 3.5 mm Input," contains unnecessary verbosity, some technical jargon, and undefined acronyms that may confuse less experienced users. For example, terms like "RCA cable" are not explained, and the absence of a diagram or graphic to illustrate these connections is an unusual omission, given the frequent inclusion of visuals elsewhere in the manual.

Here are some suggestions that may assist in improving this section to be more streamlined and easier for end-users to understand.

•    Simplify the language to reduce the use of jargon.<br>
•    Fully spell-out acronyms upon their first mention with the acronym in parenthesis.<br>
•    Include diagrams or graphics to visually depict these cables and connections referenced.

AI Statement: AI was used to assist in spellchecking and editing for clarity.
