# Chatbot
I created a simple chatbot named Foody. This bot is designed to give you food options based on your preference and location while utilizing a casual personality. I found that I had trouble figuring out where I'd like to eat, but also knew what kind of food I wanted. By giving your food preference and your location, the bot will output several options of popular restaurants that serve that type of cuisine. If you find that you change your food preference, I created an option for the bot to change it without having to start a new chat over.

This bot was made using the GUI provided by [Chatling](https://chatling.ai/). Foody utilizes ChatGPT 4.0 to generate responses.
