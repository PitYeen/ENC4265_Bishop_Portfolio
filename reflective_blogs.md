# Wayback Analysis
## A look at how websites use to be designed
Websites today look staggeringly different than how they use to ten, or even twenty years ago. [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/) is a great example of how website design can change over time, incorporating new trends and standards. Utilizing the Wayback machine, a website that allows one to view webpages as they were at a specific point in time, we can compare BuzzFeed now to what it looked like back then. This way, we can compare design trends from almost twenty years ago.

Using [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) we can view BuzzFeed as it was in July of 2007. You can [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070701055444/http://buzzfeed.com/) if you'd like to see for yourself. It may take some time to load, so be patient.

Comparing the two versions of the same website, we can notice a few things immediately. We can notice that the layout of the website is still relatively the same with the site logo at the top and a navigation bar with quick links. This was, and still is, a common trend in website design that has dated back to the earliest websites. This design has become a standard and good-practice when it comes to website design.

At a glance, the websites look identical. However, if we take a closer look and utilize some critical thinking, we can notice small differences that can tell us about a current trend. As the internet becomes more and more necessary to do almost anything, this creates a unique challenge for many users. BuzzFeed appears to have changed how much text appears on their pages, and the size of this text, making the text larger and bolder. This trend could be attributed to an effort amongst web designers to make websites more easier to read and more accessible to users with limiting disabilities. Less text on a websites makes it easier for users utilizing a screen reader to navigate; bolder and larger text makes it easier for the elder to read. If we compare this to BuzzFeed from 2007, we notice that the site doesn't incorporate these design practices. It contains a lot of small text, unnecessary sub-headings, and just generally difficult to read. A website being difficult to read and navigate for someone without a disability would mean it is practically unusable for someone with one.

Any professionally designed website will utilize accessability design practices that make it both easy to read for normal users, but also accessible to users with disabilities. Visiting this outdated website was both jarring, and painful to use. The small font along with the overabundance of text caused physical eye strain. But, this is to be expected and this may have been considered good web design. That time period was a period where good design practices were still being developed, so not everything was quite ironed out. Today, we have the luxury of good website design where professionals utilize good practices.

# Quick Start Guide
Something I've always had an issue with is Quick Start Guides. More often than not, I find them to be inadequate. They either don't include enough information, or they're just plain wrong. When I get a new device, I want to set it up quickly and get to using it, as does everyone. So, I decided to try my hand at making my own. It was for something simple, setting up a smart TV. You can download a PDF of it here.

<a href="Quick Start Guide_Bishop_Kyler.pdf">Quick Start Guide</a>

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection

## Analyzing a Customer Service Chatbot
Today, I'll be analyzing a customer service chatbot. With society becoming more and more digitized and most things migrating online, we see more companies implement these rudimentary solutions to handle the large influx of customer support calls. These things can be incredibly frustrating to deal with as they are quite limited to a select number of tasks and often don't help us with whatever issue we are presented with. I want to see how I will fair with one. Since I have AT&T fiber internet, I'll be testing out their chatbot.

Upon opening up the chat bot, I am greeted and asked what assistance I need. I'm not presented with any menu or options, so I opted to ask it something simple: "What is my account balance?" It presented my account balance and asked me if I wanted to pay, I said no. It continued to ask me to pay, which I found odd. I asked to go back to the main menu, which it then presented me with some options to lower my bill, of which there were formatting issues such that the "r" on "lower" was indented to the next line. I told the bot I'll keep my current plan.

I was then presented two options: AT&T Installment Plan and AT&T Next Up. I clicked on AT&T Next Up. The bot described it as a type of phone plan and gave me steps to cancel it. I don't have a phone plan with AT&T, so I do not know why it is acting like I do.

At this point, I was annoyed and ended the chat. The purpose of the bot is obvious: to serve as a filter of customers who's problem can be easily fixed through providing information and keeping the call center wait-times low. But, it doesn't do it that well. The bot does not appear to understand simple questions and delivers irrelevent information. I would ask one question and it would make wild assumptions. I ask what my current balance was, and it goes to cancelling a service I'm not even enrolled in. My experience was terrible, but at least it was easy to use.

I can see why companies implement these chat bots. However, I do not think I have ever had a good experience with them. I do believe this is because I do not normally need customer service outside of complex issues where a simple chatbot is not going to be able to solve. But, for the less tech-savvy users where a simple problem may be easily solvable through a chatbot, I can see these things being useful. It saves service representatives from dealing with hundreds of calls for simple problems and allows them to handle more complex problems.

## Reflecting on My Quick Start Guide
Previously, I uploaded my version of a quick start guide. Looking back, I made a lot of mistakes in it. These mistakes, at my level of education, should not have occured. Professor Johnson pointed out many of these mistakes and suggested corrective measures. 

I wrote this quick start guide to be a general guide that I assumed would apply to most Smart TVs. However, I should have focused on one specific model of TV. Not doing so could create frustrations for some readers where steps may not apply to them and cause confusion. Focusing on a specific model can prevent this frustration and confusion. Such an error would ensure readers neven return to my site.

I also put too much emphasis on the images and not enough on the text instructions. I didn't flesh out the text instructions as much as they should be, and as a result the instructions are missing important information. I mistakenly expected a reader to make assumptions, and that is poor design. The images I used also lacked propper citation. This is a significant error on my part, an error that I should not have made at this level.

In general, these errors are so simple they should not have been made. The errors pointed out are concepts that I was tought at a lower level technical writing course. They resulted in me not taking enough time to proof-read and analyze my guide. This was not a hard assignment by any means, and a way I can avoid these errors is to take more time on my deliverables. Starting them earlier will ensure I have enough time to thoroughly edit my deliverables to ensure they meet the level of quality that this course expects.

## Creating a Chatbot and AI Technology
For my previous deliverable, I was tasked with creating a chatbot to solve a specific problem. The problem I chose to tackle was finding food options based on a cuisine preferance and your location. This was a problem I often had, I could not decide where I wanted to eat. 

One of the problems I ran into was, "How was I going to train the bot?" Creating documents and skimming websites to feed into the bot would take a long time, more than I would reasonably have. So, I opted to incorporate AI, specifically ChatGPT. Chatling, the platform I utilized to make my chatbot, offered a convenient way to integrate large language models into my chatbot. 

While this was extremely convenient for me, it doesn't always do what it's told to do. One of the parameters I set for the chatbot was to not include already listed restaurants when the user requests more locations. Sometimes, the AI seems to ignore this parameter. I've noticed this behavior when using AI chatbots in the past, and ChatGPT itself. AI doesn't always follow explicit instructions given to it. I was able to fix this by manually putting in, "Do not include previous results," multiple times into the prompt that is fed into the AI model. This did appear to somewhat fix the issue, but it's still not perfect. AI is still extremely primitive and is still growing.

Years ago, chatbots were very limited in what they could do. If they were included at all, they had a very limited set of predefined responses and tasks and could often only regurgitate information already found on the website it was embedded in to. More often than not, you would still need to call into a support call center to fix any issues. With the rapid advancement of AI and large language models, chatbots are more than capable and usable now. While still limited, their capabilities to adapt and process user inputs has expanded exponentially. As this technology advances, we will see more implementation of AI. A great example is Wendy's and their implementation of AI in their drive-through ordering systems.

## Chatbot Assignment Page
Some time ago, I was given the assignment to create a chatbot. Every assignment given to me had a corresponding assignment page that details how to do the assignment, what the requirements are, and the grading rubric. All of these feaatures are critical for any assignment. If I looked at this assignment page at a different angle, it shares a lot of the same characteristics as a tutorial. Immediately, the similarities between a tutorial and an assignment page become apparent. Watching the video explanation I noticed it's set up in a familiar way. The video is done in steps: Purpose > Reason > How To > End Goal. Another similarity is the "Tips" section of the page. This section contains resources and troubleshooting content that most quick start guides would contain. The "What is Due" section could be seen as the "Final Result" or "End Goal" of a tutorial.

While there are a lot of similarities between an assignment page and a tutorial, there are just as many differences. Perhaps the most noticeable difference is the language being used. The assignment page largely asks questions while a tutorial answers questions. The page largely is task orientened versus explaining how to do a task. But, the end goal is often the same result as a tutorial.

## Making of the Procedure Video
The other week, I created a procedure video of how to install addons for a game I've been playing. It was something I frequently do and it's something I've found some people struggle with. I summized it was a great topic to make a video on. However, I ran into some problems while making it, and struggled with my own issues.

I had to redo the video several times. I've always struggled with any form of public speaking, even when I have no audience. I get extremely nervous and stumble over my words, which is present in the video. I did write a script for the video, which helped a lot. I mostly stuck to it, but in my nervousness I still made mistakes. It's not professional by any means, but I'm still proud I was able to communicate the information in a way I feel is comprehensive.

One other issue I ran in to was incredibly demotivation. While I had to retake the video several times, I was able to accomplish one without any stumbling. While reviewing the footage, I realized I hit the wrong recording option and it recorded only a specific window, not my entire desktop. This one hurt. I was satisfied with the audio, but it did not record any of my other windows, which was necessary for the tutorial.

Even after all these years or schooling, doing speeches, and talking in front of groups, I still struggle with any form of speaking. I have a long way to go, but being introverted sometimes feels like a handicap in my search for success. This assignment makes me realize I may always struggle with this, but I have to keep going.

# Final Reflection
Throughout this semester, I was tasked with various assignments to assist in honing my technical writing skills. From creating a blog website, programming a chatbot, and creating a manual, this course had me touch numerous technical writing skills necessary in the workplace.

Despite the variety of assignments in this course, I do not believe I learned anything of significance in the technical writing aspect. Much of the knowledge I gained from this course was the same knowledge I learned in a prior course. Applying many of those skills into this course made for a relatively easy semester.
But that’s not to say I did not learn anything. Despite my inclination towards technology, I never had any significant interaction with GitHub. I often found the way it was set up to be the opposite of user-friendly. This course forced me to use it, giving me a firm grasp and understanding of this resource.

A unique aspect of this course was the ability to incorporate large language models into my work, allowing me to interact with this emerging technology. I have only ever used this technology for basic tasks, so being able to use it in a productive way, such as helping edit my work or giving suggestions, created for a unique experience not commonly found in university classes as they generally prohibit any form of AI/LLMs.

Another aspect of this course that I appreciated is the professor’s thorough feedback given on each assignment. While I have taken technical writing courses in the past, I am far from proficient in it. These feedback comments were invaluable.

The work assignments in this course, while not learning anything significant, allowed me to apply some skills I have learned prior. It has allowed me to hone those skills and receive constructive feedback from a professional. Being allowed to interact with and incorporate LLMs into my work has put me ahead of many others in my field by embracing aspects of this technology to enhance my skills, putting me one step closer to graduation.
