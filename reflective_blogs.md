## A look at how websites use to be designed
Websites today look staggeringly different than how they use to ten, or even twenty years ago. [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/) is a great example of how website design can change over time, incorporating new trends and standards. Utilizing the Wayback machine, a website that allows one to view webpages as they were at a specific point in time, we can compare BuzzFeed now to what it looked like back then. This way, we can compare design trends from almost twenty years ago.

Using [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) we can view BuzzFeed as it was in July of 2007. You can [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20070701055444/http://buzzfeed.com/) if you'd like to see for yourself. It may take some time to load, so be patient.

Comparing the two versions of the same website, we can notice a few things immediately. We can notice that the layout of the website is still relatively the same with the site logo at the top and a navigation bar with quick links. This was, and still is, a common trend in website design that has dated back to the earliest websites. This design has become a standard and good-practice when it comes to website design.

At a glance, the websites look identical. However, if we take a closer look and utilize some critical thinking, we can notice small differences that can tell us about a current trend. As the internet becomes more and more necessary to do almost anything, this creates a unique challenge for many users. BuzzFeed appears to have changed how much text appears on their pages, and the size of this text, making the text larger and bolder. This trend could be attributed to an effort amongst web designers to make websites more easier to read and more accessible to users with limiting disabilities. Less text on a websites makes it easier for users utilizing a screen reader to navigate; bolder and larger text makes it easier for the elder to read. If we compare this to BuzzFeed from 2007, we notice that the site doesn't incorporate these design practices. It contains a lot of small text, unnecessary sub-headings, and just generally difficult to read. A website being difficult to read and navigate for someone without a disability would mean it is practically unusable for someone with one.

Any professionally designed website will utilize accessability design practices that make it both easy to read for normal users, but also accessible to users with disabilities. Visiting this outdated website was both jarring, and painful to use. The small font along with the overabundance of text caused physical eye strain. But, this is to be expected and this may have been considered good web design. That time period was a period where good design practices were still being developed, so not everything was quite ironed out. Today, we have the luxury of good website design where professionals utilize good practices.

# Quick Start Guide
Something I've always had an issue with is Quick Start Guides. More often than not, I find them to be inadequate. They either don't include enough information, or they're just plain wrong. When I get a new device, I want to set it up quickly and get to using it, as does everyone. So, I decided to try my hand at making my own. It was for something simple, setting up a smart TV. You can download a PDF of it here.

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection

## Analyzing a Customer Service Chatbot
Today, I'll be analyzing a customer service chatbot. With society becoming more and more digitized and most things migrating online, we see more companies implement these rudimentary solutions to handle the large influx of customer support calls. These things can be incredibly frustrating to deal with as they are quite limited to a select number of tasks and often don't help us with whatever issue we are presented with. I want to see how I will fair with one. Since I have AT&T fiber internet, I'll be testing out their chatbot.

Upon opening up the chat bot, I am greeted and asked what assistance I need. I'm not presented with any menu or options, so I opted to ask it something simple: "What is my account balance?" It presented my account balance and asked me if I wanted to pay, I said no. It continued to ask me to pay, which I found odd. I asked to go back to the main menu, which it then presented me with some options to lower my bill, of which there were formatting issues such that the "r" on "lower" was indented to the next line. I told the bot I'll keep my current plan.

I was then presented two options: AT&T Installment Plan and AT&T Next Up. I clicked on AT&T Next Up. The bot described it as a type of phone plan and gave me steps to cancel it. I don't have a phone plan with AT&T, so I do not know why it is acting like I do.

At this point, I was annoyed and ended the chat. The purpose of the bot is obvious: to serve as a filter of customers who's problem can be easily fixed through providing information and keeping the call center wait-times low. But, it doesn't do it that well. The bot does not appear to understand simple questions and delivers irrelevent information. I would ask one question and it would make wild assumptions. I ask what my current balance was, and it goes to cancelling a service I'm not even enrolled in. My experience was terrible, but at least it was easy to use.

I can see why companies implement these chat bots. However, I do not think I have ever had a good experience with them. I do believe this is because I do not normally need customer service outside of complex issues where a simple chatbot is not going to be able to solve. But, for the less tech-savvy users where a simple problem may be easily solvable through a chatbot, I can see these things being useful. It saves service representatives from dealing with hundreds of calls for simple problems and allows them to handle more complex problems.
